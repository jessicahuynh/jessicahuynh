Currently a Senior Clinical NLP Specialist at [Linguamatics](https://www.linguamatics.com), an IQVIA company; master's in computational linguistics, undergrad in computer science & linguistics, both from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu). 

I post about (mis)adventures in web development, recipes, and other things that come to mind.
