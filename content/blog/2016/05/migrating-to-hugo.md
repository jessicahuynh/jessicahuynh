I've begun the processing of migrating my blog posts from WordPress over to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. I just hand migrated the lengthiest posts (the image galleries I can do later when I figure out a good way to associate images with particular posts). Layout is all new, all improved!
