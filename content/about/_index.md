### Me

Currently a Senior Clinical NLP Specialist at [Linguamatics](https://www.linguamatics.com), an [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com) company. My views are my own and do not represent those of my company or coworkers.

I formerly worked as an NLP research assistant at [Mass General Brigham](https://www.massgeneralbrighamready.org/) (formerly Partners HealthCare) in the [MTERMS Lab](http://mterms.bwh.harvard.edu/) under PI Li Zhou.

I have a master's in computational linguistics and undergrad in computer science and linguistics, both from [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu). I also studied Modern Standard Arabic in-depth (ask me about translating Aladdin...).

My interests in NLP and ML revolve around multilinguality (especially underresourced languages), dialog management and systems, and the domain of medical NLP. Outside of that, tech-wise, I have an inexplicable fondness for web development.

When it comes to free time, I love running, casual cycling, yoga, pilates, cooking (with a special love for southeast Asian, East African, and Central American flavors), and sitting down with a good book. I'm also a casual student of interior decorating and keepng houseplants limping along.

### The website

In English and Vietnamese, heading, navigation, and copyright font is [Fira Sans](http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/). Monospace font is [Source Code Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/). The default font is [Source Sans Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-sans-pro/). Arabic text is in [Mada](https://github.com/alif-type/mada) where possible.

They are all licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).

Icons are a mixture of [Windows 10 Icons by Icons8](https://github.com/icons8/windows-10-icons) and [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather). Icons8 is double licensed under the ["Good Boy License"](https://icons8.com/good-boy-license) and [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feather Icons is also MIT.

I started with [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as a CSS framework.
I do the site development using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with code hosted on GitHub and deployment via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
