Discover Deis is a navigation app for Brandeis University, made during the summer 2015 JBS on Voice, Mobile, and Web App Development by myself, Tianci Zhong, and Ziyu Qiu. You can view the results of the summer program at deisdiscover.meteor.com and more about the JBS here, including a link to our final presentation. If you like, you can also take a gander at our GitHub repository.
