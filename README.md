Personal website built with the [hugo](gohugo.io) static site generator. Continuously deployed every time I push with Netlify. Currently using hugo 0.72.0.

LESS compiled into CSS markup with a Visual Studio code task (inside `.vscode/`). `Ctrl+Shift+B` to execute. Requires an install of `lessc`.

On a local machine, clone repo, download hugo, and run `hugo server` command. To generate website into the `public/` directory, run `hugo`.
