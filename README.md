Personal website built with the [hugo](gohugo.io) static site generator. Continuously deployed every time I push with Netlify. Currently using hugo 0.19.

LESS compiled into CSS markup with a Visual Studio code task (inside `.vscode/`).

On a local machine, clone repo, download hugo, and run `hugo server` command. To generate website into the `public/` directory, run `hugo'.
